Notice anything? Theres so much space with no purpose!

While this space could be used for skin creators to leave their signatures and the like, this project does something way more insteresting with it, it uses it to store extra data! Specifically, data about how to render your skin. This lets you do anything from making your eyes glow in the dark, have parts of your skin animate a little, or even have your arm appear metallic.
